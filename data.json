      "abstract": "In the context of the digitization of manuscripts, transcription and annotation are often distinct, sequential steps. This could lead to difficulties in improving the transcribed text when annotations have already been defined. In order to avoid this, we devised an approach which merges the two steps into the same process. Text Encoder and Annotator (TEA) is a prototype application embracing this concept. TEA is based on a lightweight language syntax which annotates text using Semantic Web technologies. Our approach is currently being developed within the Clavius on the Web project, devoted to studying the manuscripts of Christophorus Clavius, an influential 16th century mathematician and astronomer.",

      "abstract": "Linked Data sets are an ever-growing, invaluable source of information and knowledge. However, the wide adoption of this large amount of interlinked structured data is still held back by some non trivial obstacles. The one we tackle in this article is the difficulty users have in getting started with their work on Linked Data sources. In fact, querying, and in general dealing with such datasets, requires a deep knowledge about their specific classes, instances and properties. We believe that an entry point that eases the access to such information would significantly reduce the barriers around this technology and foster its promotion. Linked Data Maps is a method for representing RDF graphs as interactive, map-like visualizations, based on our previous work focused on the visual exploration of DBpedia. The approach is extended to deal with a wider range of Linked Data sets, and tested with a user evaluation study on two distinct RDF graphs.",

To contrast it, governments already adopt software solutions that support tax inspectors in their investigations. However, the currently existing systems do not normally take advantage of the constant stream of data published on the Web. Instead, the ASIA project aims to prove the effectiveness of combining this kind of open source information with official data contained in Public Administration archives to fight tax evasion. Our prototype platform deals with two cases of investigation, people and businesses. Public officers have been involved throughout the project, and took part in a preliminary test phase which showed very promising results.",
